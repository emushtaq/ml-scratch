my personal scratchbook of ML experiments

Practising lessons from Machine Learning Recipes : https://goo.gl/KewA03
- #1 Fruit Classifier : The follow along code for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw.
  A simple decision tree classifier that is trained with a hard-coded dataset.

- #2 IRIS flower classifier
  Another simple decision tree classifier using the bigger IRIS flower dataset https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNa99PG8hR8

- #3 This video predominantly explains the importance of feature and the right combination of feature. No scratchbook for this one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9fDIAflCMY

- #4 Basic pipeline for supervised learning comparing different classifiers. Understanding the approach to choosing and optimizing a model. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84gqSbLcBFE
